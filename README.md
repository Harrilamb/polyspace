Cal Poly Space Design for senior Astronautical Engineering students is an intensive course that teaches us students real life scenarios in the space industry. 

This application is being developed to help manage the vast amount of data that will be gathered throughout the year, and at the same time provide tools to help us analyze data to gather more insight during the design comparison and tradeoffs that go on throughout the lifecycle of a project.

Currently, the goal is to manage different projects from within teams. These projects have a structured "system of systems" that is what composes a design for the project. Each system can then accept design entries based on variations from students and either pass or fail, passing entries can then become the current design for a system. Because the systems are connected the changing of the current entry from another system can trigger a warning to other systems related to the one changed, keeping all teams up to date on when designs are changed in other parts of the project.

As this project is ongoing throughout the rest of this year its goal and function may shift with the needs of my class.
